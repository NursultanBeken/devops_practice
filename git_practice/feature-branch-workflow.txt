> git checkout -b new-feature master

This checks out a branch called new-feature based on master, 
and the -b flag tells Git to create the branch if it doesnâ€™t already exist.

> git status
> git add <some-file>
> git commit


> git push -u origin new-feature

This command pushes new-feature to the central repository (origin), and the -u flag adds it as a remote tracking branch.
After setting up the tracking branch, you can call git push without any parameters to push your feature.

> git checkout master
> git pull
> git pull origin new-feature
> git push
